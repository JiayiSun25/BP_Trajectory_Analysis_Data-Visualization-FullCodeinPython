# Capstone_BP_Trajectory_Analysis

This repository contains the full Python code, data, and visualizations for our capstone project on blood pressure trajectory analysis.

## Folder Structure

- `Data/`: Contains processed CSV datasets used in the analysis.
- `Python Scripts/`: Includes all Python scripts for data cleaning, BP classification, trajectory generation, and plotting.
- `Visualizations/`: Final visualization results, including:
  - BP trajectory plots based on classification types
  - Transition age scatter plots
  - Distribution pie charts

## Description

This project explores longitudinal blood pressure classification patterns using real-world data. It includes:
- Nearest date-based matching of ambulatory and visit BP measurements
- Two classification strategies
- Transition age and trajectory modeling
- Visual analytics of classification shifts and temporal trends

## Python Environment

Developed using:
- Python 3.x  
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
